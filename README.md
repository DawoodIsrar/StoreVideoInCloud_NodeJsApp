Repository Description:

Video Cloud Storage App with Express.js and MongoDB

Repository Overview:

This Git repository provides a basic implementation of an application that allows users to upload videos to a cloud storage service (such as Cloudinary) and retrieve the URL of a video based on its description. The application is built using Node.js, Express.js for the server, MongoDB for the database, and a cloud storage service for storing videos.

Features:

Video Upload:
Users can upload videos to the cloud storage service through the API. The uploaded video's metadata, including the video's name, URL, and description, are stored in the MongoDB database.

Video Retrieval by Description:
Users can retrieve the URL of a video by providing its description in the request body. The server searches the database for the video with the specified description and returns its URL.
Usage:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using npm install.
Configure your Cloudinary credentials and MongoDB connection in the code.
Run the server using node app.js or similar command.
Use API endpoints to upload videos and retrieve video URLs.
Note:
This description provides a high-level overview of the repository's purpose and features. The actual implementation of Cloudinary integration, database setup, error handling, and other details are not provided in the description but would be part of the actual codebase in the repository.
